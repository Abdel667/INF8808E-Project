    color="playlist_genre",  # Color points by season for better distinction

    title="Song Popularity by Release Season (Beeswarm Plot)",
    labels={"track_popularity": "Popularity Score", "season": "Season"},
    category_orders={
        "season": ["Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"]
    },  # Ensure consistent order
)

# --- Layout and Styling ---

# Update layout for a cleaner look
fig.update_layout(
    plot_bgcolor="white",  # Set background to white
    xaxis=dict(
        title="Track Popularity",
        showgrid=True,
        gridcolor="LightGray",
        zeroline=True,

    ),
    legend_title_text="Genre",
    boxgap=0,
    height=1000,  # Adjust height for better viewing
)

# Enhance the 'beeswarm' appearance by adjusting jitter
# A jitter of 1 distributes points across the full width of the category
# THE MOST CRITICAL PART FOR THE DESIRED VISUAL EFFECT
fig.update_traces(
    jitter=1,  # Maximize horizontal spread within the strip
    marker=dict(
        size=3,  # EXTREMELY SMALL POINTS: Essential for visualizing fine density
    ),

# --- Adding Statistical Overlays (Box Plots/Violin Plots) ---
# This is a significant improvement to show central tendency and spread.
# We will add a box plot or violin plot on top of the beeswarm.
# Violin plots are often preferred as they show density.

# Option 1: Add Violin Plots
fig.add_trace(

        points=False,  # Do not show individual points in the violin plot (already in strip plot)
        orientation="h",  # Horizontal orientation
        category_orders={"season": ["Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"]},
    )
    .update_traces(
        # Make the violin plots transparent or less prominent to let the beeswarm show through
        fillcolor="rgba(0,0,0,0)",  # Transparent fill
        line_color="black",  # Black outline
        line_width=1,
        marker_color="black",  # For the box plot part
        opacity=0.7,  # Slight opacity if using fill color
    )
    .data[0]  # Get the first trace from the violin plot
)

# Adjust layout to accommodate the new traces
fig.update_layout(showlegend=False)  # Hide the duplicate legend from the violin plot

# Reorder traces to ensure beeswarm is on top if desired (optional, depends on visual preference)
# fig.data = fig.data[::-1] # Reverse order to put strip plot on top

# --- Display and Save ---

# To display the figure in a script or notebook
fig.show()

# To save the figure to an HTML file
# fig.write_html('spotify_popularity_beeswarm.html')
